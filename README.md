# The ESTree Spec

Once upon a time, an [unsuspecting Mozilla engineer](http://calculist.org) created an API in Firefox that exposed the SpiderMonkey engine's JavaScript parser as a JavaScript API. Said engineer [documented the format it produced](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API), and this format caught on as a lingua franca for tools that manipulate JavaScript source code.

Meanwhile JavaScript is evolving. This site will serve as a community standard for people involved in building and using these tools to help evolve this format to keep up with the evolution of the JavaScript language.

# AST Descriptor Syntax

The spec uses a custom syntax to describe its structures.  For example, at the
time of writing, 'es2015.md' contained a description of `Program` as seen below

```js
extend interface Program {
    sourceType: "script" | "module";
    body: [ Statement | ModuleDeclaration ];
}
```

# Philosophy

Suggested additions and modifications must follow these guidelines:

1. **Backwards compatible:** Non-additive modifications to existing constructs will not be considered unless immense support is in favor of such changes. ([eg. #65](https://github.com/estree/estree/issues/65))
2. **Contextless:** Nodes should not retain any information about their parent. ie. a `FunctionExpression` should not be aware of if it's a concise method. (eg. [#5](https://github.com/estree/estree/issues/5))
3. **Unique:** Information should not be duplicated. ie. a `kind` property should not be present on `Literal` if the type can be discerned from the `value`. (eg. [#61](https://github.com/estree/estree/issues/61))
4. **Extensible:** New nodes should be specced to easily allow future spec additions. This means expanding the coverage of node types. ie. `MetaProperty` over `NewTarget` to cover future meta properties. (eg. [#32](https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/32))
