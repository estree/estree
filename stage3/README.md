These documents specify extensions to the core ESTree AST types to support ES
proposals that are at [stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposals#stage-3).

**NOTE:** Concensus has been reached on the AST shapes and they can largerly be
considered stable for implementers. The shape will only change if the spec
undergoes significant changes from stage 3 to stage 4.
