This document specifies the extensions to the core ESTree AST types to support the ES2020 grammar.

# Literal

```js
extend interface Literal <: Expression {
    type: "Literal";
    value: string | boolean | null | number | RegExp | bigint;
}
```

- `value` property can be a `BitInt` value to represent `BitInt` literals
  such as `100n`.

## BigIntLiteral

```js
interface BigIntLiteral <: Literal {
  bigint: string;
}
```

- `bigint` property is the string representation of the `BitInt` value.
  It includes the suffix `n`.
- In environments that don't support `BitInt` values, `value` property will be
  `null` as the `BigInt` value can't be represented natively.

# Expressions

## CallExpression

```js
interface Import <: Node {
    type: "Import";
}
```

```js
extend interface CallExpression <: Expression {
  callee: Expression | Super | Import;
}
```

- `callee` property can be an `Import` node to represent dynamic import syntax.
  E.g. `import(source)`.
- If the `callee` property was an `Import` node, `arguments` property must be an
  array that that length is `1`. The first element represents the importing
  source.
