This document specifies the extensions to the core ESTree AST types to support the ES2020 grammar.

# Literal

```js
extend interface Literal <: Expression {
    type: "Literal";
    value: string | boolean | null | number | RegExp | bigint;
}
```

- `value` property can be a `BigInt` value to represent `BigInt` literals
  such as `100n`.

## BigIntLiteral

```js
interface BigIntLiteral <: Literal {
  bigint: string;
}
```

- `bigint` property is the string representation of the `BigInt` value.
  It doesn't include the suffix `n`.
- In environments that don't support `BigInt` values, `value` property will be
  `null` as the `BigInt` value can't be represented natively.

# Expressions

## ChainingExpression

```js
interface ChainingExpression extends Expression {
  type: "ChainingExpression"
  base: Expression
  chain: [ Chain ] //< requires one element at least
}

interface Chain extends Node {
  optional: boolean
}

interface MemberChain extends Chain {
  type: "MemberChain"
  computed: boolean
  property: Expression
}

interface CallChain extends Chain {
  type: "CallChain"
  arguments: [ Expression ]
}
```

- The `ChainingExpression` node represents the chain of member accesses and
  function calls. This node is introduced to represent parentheses that
  `MemberExpression` cannot represent.
- The `MemberChain` and `CallChain` nodes correspond the existing
  `MemberExpression` and `CallExpression` nodes, but the `object` and `callee`
  properties don't exist.
  The `base` property of the `ChainingExpression` node is the object/callee of
  the first chain element, and the result of the first chain is the
  object/callee of the second chain element, and then chaining it to the last
  chain. If a chain is `optional:true` and the current object/callee is nullish,
  stop the chaining and the result of the `ChainingExpression` node becomes
  `undefined`.
- For backward compatibility, the left of optional chain element is represented
  by the `MemberExpression` and `CallExpression` nodes as in the past.
  Therefore, the `base` property of the `ChainingExpression` node can be a
  `MemberExpression` or `CallExpression` node. And the first chain element is
  always `optional:true`.

## ImportExpression

```js
interface ImportExpression <: Expression {
  type: "ImportExpression";
  source: Expression;
}
```

- `ImportExpression` node represents Dynamic Imports such as `import(source)`.
  The `source` property is the importing source as similar to [ImportDeclaration]
  node, but it can be an arbitrary expression node.

## LogicalExpression

```js
extend enum LogicalOperator {
    "||" | "&&" | "??"
}
```

- The `operator` property of the `LogicalExpression` node can be `"??"` to represent [Nullish Coalescing] syntax.

## MetaProperty

Existing [MetaProperty] node represents `import.meta` meta property as well.

# Modules

##  ExportAllDeclaration

```js
extend interface ExportAllDeclaration {
  exported: Identifier | null;
}
```
The `exported` property contains an `Identifier` when a different exported name is specified using `as`, e.g., `export * as foo from "mod";`.
