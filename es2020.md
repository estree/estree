This document specifies the extensions to the core ESTree AST types to support the ES2020 grammar.

# Literal

```js
extend interface Literal <: Expression {
    type: "Literal";
    value: string | boolean | null | number | RegExp | bigint;
}
```

- `value` property can be a `BigInt` value to represent `BigInt` literals
  such as `100n`.

## BigIntLiteral

```js
interface BigIntLiteral <: Literal {
  bigint: string;
}
```

- `bigint` property is the string representation of the `BigInt` value.
  It doesn't include the suffix `n`.
- In environments that don't support `BigInt` values, `value` property will be
  `null` as the `BigInt` value can't be represented natively.

# Expressions

## ImportExpression

```js
interface ImportExpression <: Expression {
  type: "ImportExpression";
  source: Expression;
}
```

- `ImportExpression` node represents Dynamic Imports such as `import(source)`.
  The `source` property is the importing source as similar to [ImportDeclaration]
  node, but it can be an arbitrary expression node.

## MetaProperty

Existing [MetaProperty] node represents `import.meta` meta property as well.

# Modules

##  ExportAllDeclaration

```js
extend interface ExportAllDeclaration {
  exported: Identifier | null;
}
```
The `exported` property contains an `Identifier` when a different exported name is specified using `as`, e.g., `export * as foo from "mod";`.
